# Hash/Array Extenstion

The idea of this gem is to simplify fetching records from the Hash/Array.
I had a need to read values from nested hashes, and I was tired of doing "dig/fetch", for a complex hash my code was very ugly.

So, initial idea was to "query" Hash/Array similiar how you doing it in the CSS but it was transformed a little.

Check examples below to see if it can be useful for you too.

## Demo & Usage

```ruby
    # -----
    # INITIAL DATA (see usage below)
    # -----
    hash = {
      name: "john",
      dob: Date.today,
      projects: [ {name: "A", locations: ["Kyiv"]}, {name: "B", locations: ["Paris", "Berlin"]} ],
      position: {
        company: {
          team: "position1",
          office: "position2",
          other: {
            status: "unknown",
            notes: ["note a", "note b"],
            summaries: [
              {worker: "John", level: "middle"},
              {worker: "Bob", level: "senior"}
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      locations: [ { city: "Kyiv", country: "Ukraine" }, { city: "Odessa", country: "Ukraine"}]
    }

    # -----
    # USAGE with HASH
    # -----
    hash.fpath("name") # =>  "john"
    hash.fetch_path("projects.name") # =>  ["A", "B"]
    hash.fpath("projects.locations") # => [["Kyiv"], ["Paris", "Berlin"]]
    hash.fpath!("position.company.other.summaries") # =>  [{"level" => "middle", "worker" => "John"}, {"level" => "senior", "worker" => "Bob"}]
    hash.fetch_path!("position.company.other.status") # =>  "unknown"
    hash.fpath("position.company.team+office") # =>  {"team" => "position1", "office" => "position2"}
    hash.fpath("not_exising_name") # => nil
    hash.fpath("not_exising_projects.not_exising_name") # => nil
    hash.fpath("not_exising_projects.not_exising_name", default: 42) # => 42

    # USAGE with ARRAY
    array = [{name: "igor"}, {name: "john"}]
    array.fpath("name") # => ["igor", "john"]

    array = [{user: {first_name: "john"}}, {user: {first_name: "bob"}}]
    array.fpath("user.first_name") # => ["john", "bob"]
```

### Methods & Options

`fpath` or `fetch_path` will return vakue based on path to the value. If nothing - nil.
`fpath!` or `fetch_path!` working same way as `fpath` but raise error is some key is not available.

Available options: `def fpath(key, strict: false, separator: ".", default: nil)`.

More examples available in the specs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hasharay_ext'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hasharay_ext

## Ideas

- Add support for "*" operator to search in hash/array for needed values.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
